Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.
With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.
