# Assocs-SpaceX



Assocs-SpaceX is Reactjs-Nextjs app, fetching data from SpaceX-Api. Initially performing Server Side Rendering for better perfomance and Search engine optimization.
App hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.
With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.
